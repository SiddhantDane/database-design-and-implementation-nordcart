# NordCart – Database Design and Implementation (MySQL)

This repository contains the database design and MySQL implementation for **NordCart**, a fictional e-commerce platform developed as part of the **Database Design and Implementation** module for the **BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Digitisation** programme at **Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI)**.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of relational database concepts, including:
- Database schema design
- Entity Relationship (ER) modelling
- SQL-based data definition and manipulation
- Transaction management
- Operational reporting

The database supports core e-commerce operations such as customer management, order processing, inventory control, payments, and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL 8.x
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (DDL, DML, transactions, queries)

## Repository Contents

- **sql/**  
  Contains the complete MySQL script used to create tables, insert data, process transactions, and execute reporting queries.

- **er-diagram/**  
  Contains the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing the database schema and relationships.

- **execution_log**  
  Contains execution evidence screenshot.

## How to Use

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to a MySQL 8.x server.
2. Execute the SQL script located in the `sql/` directory.
3. Review the screenshots for implementation and execution evidence.

## Academic Context

This repository is provided as **supporting evidence** for the coursework submission.  
The main academic discussion and analysis are presented in the written report, while this repository demonstrates the practical implementation.
